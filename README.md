# StockMarketSimulation
This is a simulation of stock market based on the paper &lt;&lt;The Distribution and Dynamics of Investors' Wealth on an Artificial Financial Market>>

The results can be used to analysing the wealth distribution of different types of investors and how will it change according to different environment.
